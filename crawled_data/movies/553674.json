If Coach Ram doesn't force his boys to perform convincingly, they're in danger of relegation to league two. After a series of dramatic peripeteias, Slavoj takes the field so weakened that he is caught up in the dreaded failure. Fortunately, the club's fans will eventually take their anger out on the loss of \"their\" team to an innocent referee. The film also features criticism of officials... In addition to actors Martin Růžek and Bohumil Šmída, Machov's film appeared real footballers Dukla and period sports stars (e.g. František Plánička).",

His niece Amal tells his story. Marcus Urban, on the other hand, was about to make the jump to the Bundesliga as a teenager and, by deciding to come out, he also went against his big dream.

Lions were created in 1978 under the leadership of Roman Ubakivi who wanted to start training Estonian boys when the general sports circles did not think the world’s most popular game was suitable for Estonians.  The tremendous training volumes, successful trips to competitions in the Soviet Russia, tales of happenings and work ethics that are absurd from today’s point of view all paint a colourful, warm and inspiring story of young men, their charismatic coach and everybody else who took part in their journey.  Promoted by the media, those young boys became national heroes at the end of the 1980s and, in the winds of freedom, people started to see them as the Estonian football team.  Unknowingly, the Lions were thus like the ambassadors of freedom, and even more so – the foundations of football in the newly independent Estonia.",

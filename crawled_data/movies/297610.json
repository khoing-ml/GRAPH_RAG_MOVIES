He no longer attacks people for blood, and is no longer afraid of crosses. He spends his days with his friend, Helsing XVI, a descendant of vampire researchers. Acting as Helsing’s ghost writer, he writes a fantasy romance novel about the events he witnessed in his past. One day, Alucard is dressed as a “vampire” at a Halloween costume party celebrating the publication of his book. There, he meets Lucy, a university student who dreams of becoming a dentist. As he gradually becomes more attracted to Lucy, his desire to become human grows. For a vampire with the gift of immortality, it is the equivalent of suicide.",
